	LC, MC, HC, VC = low/medium/high/very high computing
	LM, MM, HM, VM = low/medium/high/very high memory
	LS, MS, HS, VS = low/medium/high/very high storage
	LN, MN, HN, VN = low/medium/high/very high networking
	LR, MR, HR, VR = low/medium/high/very high reliability
	note:
	   - MIPS are calculated from processor's freq by assuming that 1 instruction
			is run by cycle (which of course, may not be accurate);
	   - Bandwidth is measured in mebi-Bytes/s not in mega-bits/s;
	   - Transfer rates are mesured in mebi-Bytes/s;
	   - mtbf/mttr are measured in hours;
	   - Put 0 for mtbf/mttr to disable failures/repairs for the device.
